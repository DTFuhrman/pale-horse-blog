Welcome to palehorse.

I am David. 
I live in Pittsburgh with my girlfriend Tara and my dog Joe.
I studied liberal arts, and it changed my brain.
I love learning things now.
I have been a happy generalist for most of my life, but I retrained as a programmer in 2020.
I still have too many interests, but now I spend a lot of my time studying tech.
I will mostly be writing here about tech.

Thanks for stopping by and giving it a look.
